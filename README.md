Small web design project aiming to replicate the Google homepage using basic HTML and CSS.

This project got me familiar with using Git, HTML, CSS, the command line and Chrome DevKit all together as tools for web development.

The project is from The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
